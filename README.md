# Use of Twitter to Analyze Mental Health Topics

Mental Health is an issue that has been often overlooked over a number of years, and now being taken more seriously than ever before. This project was designed to utilize big data technologies and map reduce algorithms to conduct mental health analysis on twitter.

To conduct this analysis, we use various natural language processing techniques and big data technologies to make all of this possible.

For a detailed explaination of the various methods and analysis we conducted, I encourage you to see our [report](report.pdf)!
